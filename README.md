"# TabularData_FastAI_Android"

This is a simple tabular data FastAI ML (machine learning) example, with deployment on Android.
The data contains only continuous value columns (no categorical).
The data is based on an ideal math function, without noise.

The Jupyter notebook to carry out the ML training is the file: `PlayMathFuncExample.ipynb`.

The essential code for Android is the `getPrediction` method in `MainActivity`.
